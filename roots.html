  <h1>ðŸ“œ Bee Family Origins</h1>
  <div class="content">
    <p>
      The Bee familyâ€™s legacy stretches deep into the roots of Southern heritage, grounded in resilience, faith, and generational unity.
      Our earliest known patriarch, <strong>Francis Bee Sr.</strong>, formed the foundation from which our many branches now grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      With strong ties to the Lowcountry of South Carolina, especially in the Beaufort region, the Bee family has weathered many seasons together.
      From coastal traditions to church-centered community, our lineage represents strength and connection across decades.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout generations, the family has expanded â€” children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren continue to honor the values of respect,
      hard work, and family-first legacy that <strong>Francis Bee Sr.</strong> embodied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Bee descendants live across the U.S., yet remain tightly bonded through shared stories, reunions, and a common name that continues
      to stand tall like the tree it represents.
    </p>
